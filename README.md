# CartPole AI - Reinforcement Learning

Hey, This is a project of RL on the Cartpole Problem. The cartpole Environment is already present in the Gym package and i have tried to solve it through RL <br>

## Packages Used:
* gym
* Pytorch 2.0
* Stable-Baseline3
* Pyglet == 1.5.27
 _i noticed other versions throwing some error and found a solution in [`stackoverflow`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74314778/nameerror-name-glpushmatrix-is-not-defined) so i would reccomend this version_
